Manager-Engineer Operations.

Managers can pick the tickets from the active ticket list and assign them to the engineers based on the PIN code of the customer (where the service is installed). 
There should be different managers to take care of different PIN codes. You are expected to use at least about 5 – 10 different PIN codes and there should be as many managers for assignment.


Managers should also be able to see the status of all the tickets in all the areas.

Engineers can log in and view all the tickets assigned to him/her and can pick the tickets assigned to them and assign it the status of ‘WIP”, (work on the case, which is dependent on the type of problem and resolve) and update the status as ‘RESOLVED’. 


In case they are not able to resolve the issue at their end, they can remark that this needs to be reassigned to Field Workers in case of a cable fault or at the customers’ site, and flag it as ‘ESCALATED”
